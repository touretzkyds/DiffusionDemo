# DiffusionDemo

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/touretzkyds/DiffusionDemo/blob/master/demo.ipynb)

This repository provides an in-depth exploration of stable diffusion models, walking readers through the inner workings in a step-by-step manner. 

## Getting Started

To run the demo, click "Open in Colab". Follow the instructions to execute the code and visualize diffusion in action.

## Demo Tabs Overview

1. Latent Space:
    - Denoising: Observe the intermediate images during denoising.
    - Seeds: Understand how different starting points in latent space can lead to different images.
    - Perturbations: Explore different perturbations from a point in latent space.
    - Circular: Generate a circular path in latent space and observe how the images vary along the path.
    - Poke: Perturb a region in the image and observe the effect.
    - Guidance: Observe the effect of different guidance scales.
    - Inpainting: Inpaint the image based on the prompt.

2. Clip Space:
    - Embeddings: Visualize text embedding space in 3D with input texts and output images based on the chosen axis.
    - Interpolate: Interpolate between the first and the second prompt, and observe how the output changes.
    - Negative: Observe the effect of negative prompts.
